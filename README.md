# gravitas
A connection service to intensify collaboration

Gravitas simultaneously creates intimacy and anonymity in a close-group-collaboration setting, connecting people who want short-term collboration from people who have bandwidth to give it. It maintains anonymity until a commitment to join an individual's effort is made.
